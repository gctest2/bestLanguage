## JavaScript

**Used For**: Web development (frontend & backend), mobile apps, server-side scripting

### Pros
- **Universal for Web Development**: Runs in all modern browsers, making it the go-to language for web applications.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Built-in support for async programming with Promises and async/await.
- **Huge Ecosystem**: Vast number of libraries and frameworks (React, Angular, Node.js).
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on both the client-side (browser) and server-side (Node.js).
- **Active Community**: A large, active developer community with a wealth of resources and tutorials.

### Cons
- **Single-threaded**: Can be inefficient for CPU-intensive operations, although this can be mitigated using Web Workers.
- **Callback Hell**: Although async/await resolves some issues, managing complex asynchronous operations can still be challenging.
- **Weak Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, which may lead to bugs if not properly managed.
